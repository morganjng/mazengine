# \*M\*organ&rsquo;s \*a\*ma\*z\*ing engine!!! (or \*maz\*zy engine)

This is a little game engine I&rsquo;ve been working on for the past couple of months, and I figured it&rsquo;s beginning to deserve its own repository. This engine is designed first and foremost to be readable and mod-able with less nitty-gritty, low to the metal, coding. Essentially, it is supposed to use as little C++ code as possible, and as much YAML files as are necessary for development. Additionally, I will be providing thorough documentation and perhaps even some literate programming in some of the more code intensive sections of the project.

# What is Mazengine?

Mazengine is a collection of code frameworks and outlines which is intended to be easy to add to without over-complicated code, without overly-deep nested code patterns, and without too much object-oriented abstractions. I&rsquo;m probably more opinionated and picky than the average programmer, so some other game engines really didn&rsquo;t work for me, so this is my shot at it.

# How is a Mazengine game implemented?

Mazengine comes with a certain set of classes defined that act as games, and all Mazengine games are *supposed* to be designed with certain rules in mind. In essence, a Mazengine game is implemented with hefty amounts of YAML, a couple user-defined functions, and an init file which wraps everything together. More on this later.

# Where should I go next?

Go read the docs! If they&rsquo;re extant, you should learn what you need in there.
